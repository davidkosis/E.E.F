        Congratulations to all the candidates who participated in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) Post-UTME screening for the 2023/2024 academic session. The next step in your admission journey is to check the UNN Admission List to see if you have been offered provisional admission into your chosen course of study.
      </p>
      <p>
        UNN usually releases its admission list in batches, which includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd batches. Checking the admission list is a straightforward process, and we'll guide you through each step to ensure you stay informed about your admission status.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Visit the UNN Admission Portal</h2>
      <p>
        The first step is to visit the official UNN Admission Portal. You can access the portal through the university's official website or by typing "https://unnportal.unn.edu.ng" directly into your web browser's address bar.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Access the Admission List Page</h2>
      <p>
        Once you are on the UNN Admission Portal, navigate to the "Admission List" page. This page is where the university publishes the list of candidates who have been offered provisional admission.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Choose the Batch</h2>
      <p>
        UNN usually releases the admission list in batches. Look for the section on the page that allows you to select the specific batch you want to check (e.g., 1st, 2nd, or 3rd batch).
      </p>
      <h2>4. Enter Your Details</h2>
      <p>
        On the admission list page, you will be required to enter your JAMB Registration Number or Application Number in the provided space. Ensure that you enter the correct information to get accurate results.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Check Your Admission Status</h2>
      <p>
        After entering your details, click on the "Check Admission Status" button. The portal will then display your admission status. If you have been offered admission, congratulations! You can proceed with the necessary steps for acceptance and registration. If your name is not on the current batch, don't worry, as there may be subsequent batches to be released.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Keep Checking for Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Admission lists are sometimes updated or revised. If you don't find your name on the current batch, keep checking the admission portal regularly for updates on subsequent batches. Admissions may also be offered to candidates on the waiting list or supplementary list in subsequent releases.
      </p>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Checking the UNN Admission List is an important step in the admission process. It is essential to be patient and stay informed by regularly visiting the university's admission portal for updates. We wish all candidates the best of luck in their admission journey and academic pursuits at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.
